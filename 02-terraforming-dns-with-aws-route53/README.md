# Terraforming DNS with AWS Route53

This set of Terraform files configures DNS in AWS Route53, plus an example email service such as ProtonMail

You won't be able to use the code as-is. It requires the following:

* A valid domain name
* A ProtonMail subscription to get access to the verification and public keys information
